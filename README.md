# GoldMaps Ruby on Rails Software Project

This is the goldmaps project that I worked on in the software projects module. The goldmaps application was created to store all the rooms in the database which were in the Goldsmiths University. Working on the project my main goals were to make a CMS (content management system) which could be used by an administator as well as creating a RESt API for the client side frontend application.
